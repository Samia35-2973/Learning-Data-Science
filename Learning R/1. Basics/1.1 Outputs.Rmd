# Outputs

### Printing Something

you can output code in R without using a print function. Use quotes for string.

```{r}
34
344
"Hello I am Tisha"
```

### print()

We can use print() if we want. However, when your code is inside an R expression (e.g. inside curly braces {} like in the example above), use the print() function to output the result.

```{r}
print("I am learning R.")
```
